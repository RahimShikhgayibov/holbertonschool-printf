.TH _PRINTF 3 "January 2024" "Holberton" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.B int _printf(const char *\fIformat\fB, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B _printf()
writes output to stdout, the standard output stream, according to a format string. This function is similar to the standard printf function.
.SP
The function writes the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SH OPTIONS
The format string is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
.SP
The following conversion specifiers are handled:
.TP
.B c
Convert the argument (an int) to an unsigned char, and write the resulting character.
.TP
.B s
The argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
